# data_mining_project

The dataset for this project originates from a rich supply chain and sales context, aiming to explore various facets of customer behavior, product performance, and logistical efficiency. It includes a wealth of data entries and features that span sales information, shipping details, and product categories. The primary research question for this project is: How can data-driven insights enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction in supply chain management?

SMART QUESTION:
●	What factors most significantly impact delivery times, and how can we mitigate the risk of late deliveries?
●	Can customer purchasing patterns be predicted to enhance inventory management and marketing strategies?
●	How does the product category relate to sales performance, and can this insight inform inventory stocking?
●	What is the relationship between shipping mode choice and customer satisfaction or sales benefit?
●	Is there any significant difference in average order profit between regions?

MODELLING METHODS:
●	Descriptive Analysis: Summary statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualizations
●	Customer Segmentation: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering
●	Sales and Shipping Forecasting: Linear regression and ARIMA models
●	Delivery Risk Prediction: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
●	Advanced Predictive Modeling: Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and XGBoost
●	Optimization: Linear programming for supply chain optimization

Product Trend Analysis and Sales Trends Overtime
1. Product Trend Analysis: Utilizing ANOVA tests to understand the impact of different variables on sales and product categories purchased in specific periods.
Using visualization technique to identify total no. of sales for each product category.
Assigning product category into different groups and observing the maximum sales for each group.

2. Temporal Analysis: Investigating sales trends over time, identifying peak months, and the months where the sales went low, and understanding yearly fluctuations. 
Examining each trend over time and identifying those product categories that remained in demand despite the downfall in the market for a proper inventory management for the particular category.
